<h2>Getting Here</h2>
<h3>Buffalo-Niagara International Airport (BUF)</h3>
<p>The Buffalo airport is a very affordable airport to fly to. The airport is a 20 minute drive from downtown Buffalo. It is not necessary to rent a car. Taxis are readily available to be hailed or called in downtown Buffalo. A taxi ride from the airport will cost about $50 each direction, so we would recommend checking with your hotel first, as many downtown Buffalo hotels have an airport shuttle service. You can also book a shuttle through <a href="http://www.buffaloairporttaxi.com/our-services">Buffalo Airport Taxi</a> to take you to downtown Buffalo for $21 each way.</p>
<h3>Crossing the border</h3>
<p>For our Canadian guests, please don&rsquo;t forget that you will need a passport to cross the U.S. border. If you will be crossing the border the day of the wedding, we recommend leaving yourself plenty of time. Although our wedding is only about ten minutes from the border on the U.S. side, you should allow some extra time in case of any delays at the border (whether it&rsquo;s long line-ups, or being randomly called into secondary questioning.)</p>
<p>For our American guests, don&rsquo;t forget to bring your passports if you want to do any Canadian sightseeing during your visit! Downtown Buffalo is only ten minutes from the Canadian border, and Niagara Falls is only 30 minutes away.</p>
<h3>Weather</h3>
<p>For those who have never been to Buffalo, you may be wondering what to expect from the weather. The typical weather in early November is around 50째F (10째C) during the daytime and 38째F (3째C) overnight. It is very unlikely that we&rsquo;ll have snow that early in the year, but be sure to check the weather a few days before your trip so you can pack appropriately, just in case!</p>
